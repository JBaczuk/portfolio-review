        <h2 id="title-c">Etymology</h2>
        <p class="text">
            The term Blues may have come from "blue devils", meaning melancholy 
            and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in George 
            Colman's one-act farce Blue Devils (1798). The phrase blue devils 
            may also have been derived from Britain in the 1600s, when the term 
            referred to the "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe 
            alcohol withdrawal". As time went on, the phrase lost the reference 
            to devils, and it came to mean a state of agitation or depression. 
            By the 1800s in the United States, the term blues was associated with 
            drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase blue law, which 
            prohibits the sale of alcohol on Sunday. Though the use of the phrase in 
            African-American music may be older, it has been attested to in print since 
            1912, when Hart Wand's "Dallas Blues" became the first copyrighted blues 
            composition. In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood.
            The phrase "the blues" was written by Charlotte Forten, then aged 25, in her 
            diary on December 14, 1862. She was a free-born black woman from Pennsylvania 
            who was working as a schoolteacher in South Carolina, instructing both slaves 
            and freedmen, and wrote that she "came home with the blues" because she felt 
            lonesome and pitied herself. She overcame her depression and later noted a 
            number of songs, such as Poor Rosy, that were popular among the slaves. 
            Although she admitted being unable to describe the manner of singing 
            she heard, Forten wrote that the songs "can't be sung without a full heart and 
            a troubled spirit", conditions that have inspired countless blues songs.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1920s</h2>
            <p class="text">
                In the 1920s, the blues became a major element of African 
                American and American popular music, reaching white audiences 
                via Handy's arrangements and the classic female blues performers. 
                The blues evolved from informal performances in bars to entertainment 
                in theaters. Blues performances were organized by the Theater Owners 
                Bookers Association in nightclubs such as the Cotton Club and juke joints 
                such as the bars along Beale Street in Memphis. Several record companies, 
                such as the American Record Corporation, Okeh Records, and Paramount Records, 
                began to record African-American music. As the recording industry grew, country 
                blues performers like Bo Carter, Jimmie Rodgers, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Lonnie Johnson, 
                Tampa Red and Blind Blake became more popular in the African American community. Kentucky-born 
                Sylvester Weaver was in 1923 the first to record the slide guitar style, in which a guitar 
                is fretted with a knife blade or the sawed-off neck of a bottle. The slide guitar became an 
                important part of the Delta blues. The first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized 
                as a traditional, rural country blues and a more polished city or urban blues.
                Country blues performers often improvised, either without accompaniment or with only a banjo 
                or guitar. Regional styles of country blues varied widely in the early 20th century. The (Mississippi) 
                Delta blues was a rootsy sparse style with passionate vocals accompanied by slide guitar. The little-recorded 
                Robert Johnson combined elements of urban and rural blues. In addition to Robert Johnson, influential performers 
                of this style included his predecessors Charley Patton and Son House. Singers such as Blind Willie McTell and Blind Boy 
                Fuller performed in the southeastern "delicate and lyrical" Piedmont blues tradition, which used an elaborate ragtime-based 
                fingerpicking guitar technique. Georgia also had an early slide tradition, with Curley Weaver, Tampa Red, "Barbecue Bob" Hicks 
                and James "Kokomo" Arnold as representatives of this style.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1950s</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The transition from country blues to urban blues that began in the 
            1920s was driven by the successive waves of economic crisis and booms 
            that led many rural blacks to move to urban areas, in a movement known 
            as the Great Migration. The long boom following World War II induced 
            another massive migration of the African-American population, the 
            Second Great Migration, which was accompanied by a significant increase 
            of the real income of the urban blacks. The new migrants constituted a 
            new market for the music industry. The term race record, initially used 
            by the music industry for African-American music, was replaced by the term 
            rhythm and blues. This rapidly evolving market was mirrored by Billboard 
            magazine's Rhythm and Blues chart. This marketing strategy reinforced trends 
            in urban blues music such as the use of electric instruments and amplification 
            and the generalization of the blues beat, the blues shuffle, which became ubiquitous 
            in rhythm and blues (R&B). This commercial stream had important consequences for blues 
            music, which, together with jazz and gospel music, became a component of R&B.

          <h2 id="title-c">1960s and 1970s</h2>
            <p class="text">
                By the beginning of the 1960s, genres influenced by African American 
                music such as rock and roll and soul were part of mainstream popular 
                music. White performers such as the Beatles had brought African-American 
                music to new audiences, both within the U.S. and abroad. However, the 
                blues wave that brought artists such as Muddy Waters to the foreground 
                had stopped. Bluesmen such as Big Bill Broonzy and Willie Dixon started 
                looking for new markets in Europe. Dick Waterman and the blues festivals 
                he organized in Europe played a major role in propagating blues music 
                abroad. In the UK, bands emulated U.S. blues legends, and UK blues rock-based 
                bands had an influential role throughout the 1960s.
                Blues performers such as John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters continued to 
                perform to enthusiastic audiences, inspiring new artists steeped in traditional 
                blues, such as New Yorkâ€“born Taj Mahal. John Lee Hooker blended his blues style with 
                rock elements and playing with younger white musicians, creating a musical style that 
                can be heard on the 1971 album Endless Boogie. B. B. King's singing and virtuoso guitar 
                technique earned him the eponymous title "king of the blues". King introduced a sophisticated 
                style of guitar soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that influenced 
                many later electric blues guitarists. In contrast to the Chicago style, King's band used strong 
                brass support from a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone, instead of using slide guitar or harp. 
                Tennessee-born Bobby "Blue" Bland, like B. B. King, also straddled the blues and R&B genres. 
                During this period, Freddie King and Albert King often played with rock and soul musicians 
                (Eric Clapton and Booker T & the MGs) and had a major influence on those styles of music.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1980s to the present</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Since the 1980s there has been a resurgence of interest in the blues 
            among a certain part of the African-American population, particularly 
            around Jackson, Mississippi and other deep South regions. Often termed "soul 
            blues" or "Southern soul", the music at the heart of this movement was given 
            new life by the unexpected success of two particular recordings on the 
            Jackson-based Malaco label Z. Z. Hill's Down Home Blues (1982) and Little 
            Milton's The Blues is Alright (1984). Contemporary African-American performers 
            who work in this style of the blues include Bobby Rush, Denise LaSalle, 
            Sir Charles Jones, Bettye LaVette, Marvin Sease, Peggy Scott-Adams, Mel Waiters, 
            Clarence Carter, Dr. "Feelgood" Potts, O.B. Buchana, Ms. Jody, Shirley Brown, and 
            dozens of others. Eric Clapton performing at Hyde Park, London, in June 2008
            During the 1980s blues also continued in both traditional and new forms. In 1986 the 
            album Strong Persuader announced Robert Cray as a major blues artist. The first Stevie 
            Ray Vaughan recording Texas Flood was released in 1983, and the Texas-based guitarist 
            exploded onto the international stage. John Lee Hooker's popularity was revived with the 
            album The Healer in 1989. Eric Clapton, known for his performances with the Blues Breakers 
            and Cream, made a comeback in the 1990s with his album Unplugged, in which he played some 
            standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar.
