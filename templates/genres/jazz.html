        <h2 id="title-c">Etymology</h2>
        <p class="text">
            The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, 
            and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to 
            jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning "pep, energy". 
            The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the 
            Los Angeles Times in which a minor league baseball pitcher described 
            a pitch which he called a "jazz ball" "because it wobbles and you 
            simply can't do anything with it".
            The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 
            1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune. Its first documented use in a 
            musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916, 
            Times-Picayune article about "jas bands". In an interview with 
            National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections 
            of the slang connotations of the term, saying: "When Broadway picked 
            it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was 
            spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you 
            wouldn't say it in front of ladies." The American Dialect Society 
            named it the Word of the 20th Century.

          <h2 id="title-c">Swing in the early 20th century</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Morton loosened ragtime's rigid rhythmic feeling, decreasing its 
                embellishments and employing a swing feeling. Swing is the most 
                important and enduring African-based rhythmic technique used in 
                jazz. An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is: 
                "if you don't feel it, you'll never know it." The New Harvard 
                Dictionary of Music states that swing is: "An intangible rhythmic 
                momentum in jazz...Swing defies analysis; claims to its presence 
                may inspire arguments." The dictionary does nonetheless provide 
                the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat 
                contrasted with duple subdivisions swing superimposes six 
                subdivisions of the beat over a basic pulse structure or four 
                subdivisions. This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in 
                African-American music than in Afro-Caribbean music. One aspect of 
                swing, which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics, 
                places strokes in-between the triple and duple-pulse "grids".

          <h2 id="title-c">Swing in the 1920s and 1930s</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some virtuoso 
            soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing 
            the "big" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers Count Basie, Cab 
            Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher 
            Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry James, Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller and 
            Artie Shaw. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered 
            individual musicians a chance to "solo" and improvise melodic, thematic 
            solos which could at times be complex "important" music. Over time, social 
            strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white 
            bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white 
            ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson, 
            vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join 
            small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor 
            saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop 
            influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as "jumping the blues" 
            or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, 
            drawing on boogie-woogie from the 1930s.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1940s</h2>
            <p class="text">
                In the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy 
                Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from 
                danceable popular music towards a more challenging "musician's music." 
                Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, 
                establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular 
                and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, 
                it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and 
                dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or "flatted fifth") interval 
                became the "most important interval of bebop" and players engaged in a more 
                abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used "passing" chords, 
                substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well 
                to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to 
                keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed 
                to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated 
                harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often 
                used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of 
                their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are 
                Gillespie's "Salt Peanuts" (1941) and "A Night in Tunisia" (1942), 
                Parker's "Anthropology" (1946), "Yardbird Suite" (1946) and "Scrapple from 
                the Apple" (1947), and Monk's "'Round Midnight" (1944), which is currently 
                the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1950s</h2>
          <p class="text">
            By the end of the 1940s, the nervous energy and tension of bebop was 
            replaced with a tendency towards calm and smoothness, with the sounds 
            of cool jazz, which favoured long, linear melodic lines. It emerged in 
            New York City, as a result of the mixture of the styles of predominantly 
            white swing jazz musicians and predominantly black bebop musicians, and 
            it dominated jazz in the first half of the 1950s. The starting point were 
            a series of singles on Capitol Records in 1949 and 1950 of a nonet led by 
            trumpeter Miles Davis, collected and released first on a ten-inch and later 
            a twelve-inch as the Birth of the Cool. Cool jazz recordings by Chet Baker, 
            Dave Brubeck, Bill Evans, Gil Evans, Stan Getz and the Modern Jazz Quartet 
            usually have a "lighter" sound which avoided the aggressive tempos and 
            harmonic abstraction of bebop. Cool jazz later became strongly identified 
            with the West Coast jazz scene, but also had a particular resonance in 
            Europe, especially Scandinavia, with emergence of such major figures as 
            baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin and pianist Bengt Hallberg. The theoretical 
            underpinnings of cool jazz were set out by the blind Chicago pianist Lennie 
            Tristano, and its influence stretches into such later developments as Bossa 
            nova, modal jazz, and even free jazz. See also the list of cool jazz and West 
            Coast musicians for further detail.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1960s</h2>
            <p class="text">
                In the late 1960s, Latin jazz, combining rhythms from African and 
                Latin American countries, often played on instruments such as conga, 
                timbale, güiro, and claves, with jazz and classical harmonies played on 
                typical jazz instruments (piano, double bass, etc.) broke through. There 
                are two main varieties: Afro-Cuban jazz was played in the US right after 
                the bebop period, while Brazilian jazz became more popular in the 1960s. 
                Afro-Cuban jazz began as a movement in the mid-1950s as bebop musicians 
                such as Dizzy Gillespie and Billy Taylor started Afro-Cuban bands influenced 
                by such Cuban and Puerto Rican musicians as Xavier Cugat, Tito Puente, and 
                Arturo Sandoval. Brazilian jazz such as bossa nova is derived from samba, 
                with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music 
                styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese 
                or English. The style was pioneered by Brazilians João Gilberto and Antônio 
                Carlos Jobim. The related term jazz-samba describes an adaptation of bossa 
                nova compositions to the jazz idiom by American performers such as Stan Getz 
                and Charlie Byrd.

          <p class="text">
            In the 1970s in jazz, jazz become increasingly influenced by Latin 
            jazz, combining rhythms from African and Latin American countries, 
            often played on instruments such as conga, timbale, güiro, and claves, 
            with jazz and classical harmonies played on typical jazz instruments 
            (piano, double bass, etc.). Artists such as Chick Corea, John McLaughlin 
            and Al Di Meola increasingly influenced the genre with jazz fusion, a 
            hybrid form of jazz-rock fusion which was developed by combining jazz 
            improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments, and the highly 
            amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix. All Music 
            Guide states that "..until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were 
            nearly completely separate." However, "...as rock became more creative and 
            its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with 
            hard bop and did not want to play strictly avant-garde music, the two 
            different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces." 
            On June 16, 1972 the New York Jazz Museum opened in New York City at 125 
            West 55th Street in a one and one-half story building. It became the most 
            important institution for jazz in the world with a 25,000 item archive, 
            free concerts, exhibits, film programs, etc.

            <p class="text">
                The 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free 
                jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged 
                early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed 
                was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating 
                extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists 
                such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as the hard bop of the 
                1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was 
                a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the 
                resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s 
                (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other 
                manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free 
                jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.

          <p class="text">
            Since the 1990s, jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which 
            no one style dominates, but rather a wide range of styles and genres are 
            popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes 
            in the same performance. Pianist Brad Mehldau and The Bad Plus have explored 
            contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic 
            piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. 
            The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. 
            A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, 
            such as saxophonists Greg Osby and Charles Gayle, while others, such as James 
            Carter, have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.
            Harry Connick Jr. began his career playing stride piano and the dixieland jazz 
            of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was 10 years 
            old. Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist Ellis Marsalis. 
            Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the 
            movie When Harry Met Sally, which sold over two million copies. Crossover 
            success has also been achieved by Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Cassandra Wilson, 
            Kurt Elling, and Jamie Cullum.
