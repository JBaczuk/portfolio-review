        <h2 id="title-c">Etymology</h2>
        <p class="text">
            David Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as "a body of music 
            which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music". According to 
            Pete Seeger, pop music is "professional music which draws upon both folk 
            music and fine arts music". David Boyle, a music researcher, states pop music 
            as any type a music that a person has been exposed to by the mass media.  
            Most individuals think that pop music is just the singles charts and not the 
            sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of 
            sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. As a genre, 
            pop music is seen to exist and develop separately. Therefore, the term 
            "pop music" may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to 
            all, often characterized as "instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers" 
            in contrast to rock music as "album-based music for adults".
            Pop music continuously evolves along with the term's definition. 
            According to music writer Bill Lamb, popular music is defined as 
            "the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line 
            with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class." The term 
            "pop song" was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music 
            "having popular appeal". Hatch and Millward indicate that many events 
            in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of 
            the modern pop music industry, including in country, blues, and 
            hillbilly music.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1950s</h2>
            <p class="text">
                It began in the age of rock ‘n roll. In the ’50s, the music of 
                the previous decades—including swing music and crooning 
                vocals—was being replaced. Rock was growing, and at the same 
                time as it did, the beginning of true pop music was growing too, 
                out of the creations of producer Mitch Miller. Miller worked at 
                the most successful label of the time, Columbia Records, and he 
                working with the label’s big artists to create a sound that was 
                not confined to one simple genre. He was combining country, 
                blues, and folk music with the mainstream rock sounds that 
                everyone was listening to, and the result was something that 
                took the focus away from the large, sweeping orchestras of the 
                previous decades, and placed it on the emotion of the music, 
                evident in the sounds of artists like Johnnie Ray, Frankie Laine, 
                and Guy Mitchell — all of whom worked with Mitch Miller. 
                This decade was also one of celebration for Elvis Presley, who 
                came around in 1953, and whose songs, like “Hound Dog” were 
                some of the most loved of the time.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1960s</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Through its beginning, pop had been characterized by its largely 
            teen fan base, and in the ‘60s, when the portable radio was 
            introduced, it became even easier for teens to take their tunes 
            wherever they went. Pop was traveling, and picking up influences — 
            from the beaches of California, bands like the Beach Boys were taking 
            the harmonies from traditional pop songs and layering them with the 
            “surf rock” rhythm that they became known for. But the true driving 
            force of pop in the ‘60s came from across the Atlantic, with 
            Beatlemania and the British Invasion into the American charts. 
            The British Invasion brought rock and pop music and bands to the 
            U.S., where they became wildly popular. The Beatles were among these 
            acts, and their mix of beat, rock, and pop ballads immediately took 
            over American pop charts. Other bands that took part in this invasion 
            included the English pop rock group, The Dave Clark Five. Their 
            single, “Over and Over” was number one on American charts in 1965, 
            beating out the Beatles. Through all of this, the pop genre was 
            forming into something not solely defined by the American solo-pop 
            artists of the previous decade. Now, bands were introduced into the 
            fray, and pop was splitting into sub-genres that included Bubblegum 
            pop—defined by its upbeat sound and its direct aim at teen 
            audiences—and Baroque pop, which blended pop and rock and baroque 
            music together.

            <p class="text">
                Those subgenres of pop began towards the end of the ‘60s, 
                but died out in the ’70s. In their place came the subgenre of 
                power pop, a mix of punk rock and pop, defined by bands like the 
                Romantics, and Cheap Trick. At the same time, country pop was 
                emerging, which stemmed from country artists’ attempts to reach a 
                more mainstream audience. Suddenly, the hooks and melodies of pop 
                were intertwining with the twang and drawl of country music. But 
                the biggest thing the ‘70s did for pop music came in the form of a 
                pop-rock sound: this was the beginning of the era of the Jackson 5, 
                Elton John, and Queen. Elton John, with his repertoire of diverse 
                sounds ranging from pop ballads to arena rock songs, became one of 
                the biggest pop stars of the time. “Bennie and the Jets” and “Don’t 
                Go Breaking My Heart” are regarded today as musical classics. 
                Meanwhile, Queen was venturing from their hard rock song into the 
                arena rock and pop rock that was so popular on the radio at the time, 
                and the Jackson 5 was becoming a pop phenomenon with their own hit 
                singles, like “I Want You Back” and “ABC”.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 1980s</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Digital recording became huge in the ‘80s, and the possibilities it 
            offered allowed pop music to grow even more. Suddenly, synthesizers and 
            electronic sounds could be put into pop music, and as this kind of 
            dance-pop developed, so did genres like techno. And the artists who 
            emerged in these years were revolutionary for pop—Michael Jackson’s 
            Thrilleris still the best-selling album of all time. Jackson was 
            becoming the biggest pop star of the decade, followed closely by 
            Prince, who had his own pop stardom to claim. His music, which pulled 
            from pop, rock, funk, and so much more, coupled with his extravagant 
            and flamboyant presence catapulted him into a spotlight never truly 
            faded away. Female pop powerhouses were also coming into play, like 
            Whitney Houston and Madonna. The latter became the most successful 
            female artist of the decade, with songs like “Like A Virgin”. The ‘80s 
            was creating a pop-music culture like no other decade had before it, 
            a culture that would carry through in the decades to come.

                While the ‘90s saw pop continuing much as it had been in the 
                past, what it introduced to the genre was girl groups. The 
                decade saw the British Girl group, The Spice Girls, emerge into 
                the American market and become the most commercially successful 
                British Group in North America since the Beatles. They were also 
                the most successful female-pop group, and one of the most 
                successful pop-groups ever, with their single “Spice Up Your Life”. 
                The next ten years would see teen pop groups and singers pop up all 
                over the charts, including the Backstreet Boys with “Quit Playing Games 
                (With My Heart)”, and Britney Spears with “Baby One More Time” — one 
                of the best-selling singles of all time.

          <h2 id="title-c">The 2000s-Present</h2>
          <p class="text">
            By the 2000s, pop was a genre with endless roads for artists to 
            travel down, each with its own flair and twist to the classic 
            traditions of pop music. Teen pop was existing in the music of 
            Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera; pop rock and power pop were 
            making a comeback in the sounds of Blink 182’s “All the Small Things”, 
            opening up a gate for the musicians that would come to be pivotal 
            within the pop-punk genre, like Simple Plan and Fall Out Boy. 
            Towards the end of the first decade of the 2000s, pop was again being 
            influenced with hip hop and R&B sounds through Rihanna’s music, and 
            electronic sounds made themselves known in Lady Gaga’s sounds from her 
            album, Poker Face, which went on to win two Grammys. Pop music had 
            become an electric melting pot of subgenres and sounds that all shared 
            the common tropes of a pop song.
